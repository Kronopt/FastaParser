A Python FASTA file Parser and Writer.

The FASTA file format is a standard text-based format for representing nucleotide and aminoacid sequences
(usual file extensions include: .fasta, .fna, .ffn, .faa and .frn).
FastaParser is able to parse such files and extract the biological sequences within into Python objects.
It can also handle and manipulate such sequences as well as write sequences to new or existing FASTA files.
